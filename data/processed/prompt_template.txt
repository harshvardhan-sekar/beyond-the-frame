You are analyzing a sequence of comic book panels. You will see 4 images: 3 context panels followed by 1 target panel.

YOUR TASK: Look at all 4 panel images carefully. Based on the visual story and dialogue from the first 3 panels, predict what text and action occurs in the 4th panel.

IMPORTANT: 
- The images contain CLEAR, READABLE text in speech bubbles, narration boxes, and signs
- The OCR text provided below is a rough extraction and may be incomplete or concatenated
- TRUST THE IMAGES as your primary source - use OCR text only as a backup reference

OCR TEXT FROM CONTEXT PANELS (may be incomplete):
Panel 1: "[PANEL 1 TEXT]"
Panel 2: "[PANEL 2 TEXT]"
Panel 3: "[PANEL 3 TEXT]"

Now analyze the 4th panel image and generate:

DIALOGUE: Character speech from speech bubbles. If multiple speakers, distinguish them by description (e.g., "MAN IN SUIT: ...", "WOMAN: ..."). Use "" if no dialogue.

NARRATION: Text from narrator caption boxes (usually rectangular boxes at top/bottom). Use "" if none.

SOUND_EFFECTS: Onomatopoeia like CRASH!, POW!, WHOOSH! (often stylized text). Use "" if none.

SCENE_DESCRIPTION: Describe what is visually happening - characters, actions, poses, expressions, setting, mood. Be specific and detailed.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON:
{"dialogue": "...", "narration": "...", "sound_effects": "...", "scene_description": "..."}
